# Re-include the normally hidden $'Icon\r' files here.
# They specify icons to assign to the services, and are picked up by Finder
# automatically (they were added by interactively pasting into the Cmd-I dialog).
# Sadly, we couldn't find a way to add icons more robustly, via the 
# Info.plist file.

# !! DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WITH A TEXT EDITOR, as the \r
# !! characters are converted to \n.
# !! Instead, remove the remaining lines and >> the following from a shell
# !!   printf '!Icon\r\r\n' >> .gitignore
